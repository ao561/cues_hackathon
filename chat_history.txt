Confirm everyone's availability\n2. Choose a specific pizza place\n3. Plan for ice cream after lunch\n\nWould you like me to help you narrow down a specific pizza restaurant in Cambridge?"}
{"sender": "AI Assistant", "message": "I apologize for the technical difficulties. Based on the conversation and available information, here's my recommendation:\n\nRecommendation: A pizza place in Cambridge that offers:\n- Variety of pizzas (including pineapple for Amaan)\n- Lighter options for Ardil\n- Potentially some curry-inspired toppings to satisfy Mahdi and Amaan\n- Option for coffee and ice cream afterwards\n\nSuggested next steps:\n1. Those in Cambridge (Amaan, Mahdi, Ardil) can meet up first\n2. Hayyan in London might join later or meet at a different location\n3. Simon at Birmingham might need to travel\n\nAdditional suggestions:\n- Consider a casual dining place with multiple food options\n- Plan for coffee and ice cream after the main meal\n- Coordinate timing based on everyone's current location\n\nWould you like me to help find a specific restaurant in Cambridge that meets these requirements? I can use the tools to search for a suitable location once you confirm the plan.\n\nWould you like me to:\n- Find a specific restaurant in Cambridge\n- Help coordinate travel for the group\n- Look for a place that accommodates everyone's dietary preferences"}
